		<p>This is a short story about myself. I grew up in Oklahoma. I went to college at Oklahoma State University. After graduation I moved out here to get closer to the mountains. I found a job as a lab manager for a hydrocarbon processing facility in denver. That's just a fancy way to say I make dabs for a living. I spend my free time working out, hiking and watching anime.</p>
